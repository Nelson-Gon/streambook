# Streambook



Proof of concept of a live updating Python repl. (inspired by https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/) 

* Write your code in any editor
* Watches and updates a live notebook
* Creates a jupyter notebook in the background

Hooks together streamlit + jupytext + watchdog to make this work.
